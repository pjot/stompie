stompie
=============

Native implementation of a PHP Stomp client that's meant to mimic the Stomp extension: http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.stomp.php

It might seem like a stupid idea to write this, but it's meant to eventually be a drop-in replacement for the extension for situations when you cannot install it (it is not officially supported by RHEL for example).
